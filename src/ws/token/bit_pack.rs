/// Packs tokens into a compact bitwise encoding.
///
/// The final element in the store of the resulting `BitVec` may be only
/// partially filled with bits.
///
/// # Encoding
///
/// Tokens are encoded with a variable number of bits:
/// - `S` maps to `0`
/// - `T` maps to `10`
/// - `L` maps to `11`
///
/// This means that the bits do not end at a byte (or, in general, a
/// [`BitStore`](bitvec::store::BitStore)) boundary. If the final byte were to
/// be filled with `0`s, then most programs would decode with extra `S` tokens.
/// Likewise, if filled with `1`s, there would be extra `L` tokens. To resolve
/// this ambiguity, if the final bit is a `0`, then a marker `1` bit is appended
/// before the trailing zeros, which is ignored when unpacking.
///
/// # History
///
/// This continues my tradition of including bit packing in each of my major
/// Whitespace implementations, following [Respace], [Nebula], and [yspace].
/// Unlike the others, which were `Msb0`, this has configurable bit order.
///
/// As far as I can tell, Respace was the first implementation of this algorithm
/// and had been discovered independently, though it had been mentioned
/// theoretically [in 2012](https://github.com/wspace/corpus/tree/main/python/res-trans32).
