/// ### Line width limit
///
/// Due to the instruction encoding scheme, the absolute line width limit can be
/// approximated:
///
/// `push` is terminated with an L and can be preceded on the same line with any
/// number of instructions that do not contain L, that is, `add`, `sub`, `div`,
/// `mod`, `store`, `retrieve`, and `shuffle`. This subset of instructions would
/// not be very useful to repeat excessively in sequence, though `retrieve` and
/// `shuffle` could be arbitrarily repeated without requiring a large stack. 128
/// of these instructions followed by a 4096-bit `push` would be up to 4611
/// tokens on a line.
///
/// Labeled control flow instructions contain an L in the opcode and one
/// terminating the label, so always span a full line. With the convention of
/// representing textual labels using eight S/T tokens per byte and a
/// pathological 2048-byte label (the identifier length limit in some C++
/// compilers), that would be 16384 tokens for the label, plus three more for
/// the opcode.
///
/// `slide` also spans a full line, but stack sizes are usually small and its
/// argument length is logarithmic to the size of the stack, so it wouldn't be
/// more than a few tokens long.
///
/// Comments are not similarly constrained and could be arbitrarily long, but
/// should not occur more than a ratio of 10:1 with STL tokens, even in
/// steganographic programs.
///
/// ### File count limit
///
/// There should be no case where over 65,535 files would be compiled at once.
/// Even the Linux kernel has less overall files than that.
